					<h1> THE EXPERIENCE </h1>
					<p> 
						For us, a great experience begins with the Event Design. Once we agree on a flow that works best in the space we have, the Fixed Costs in your budget will take shape. 
						We’ll know based on your estimated number of guests how much Service you’ll need and then we can begin talking about a Menu that will perfectly compliment the experience you desire.

					<h1> AFFORDABLE </h1>
					<p> 
						We Are All Inclusive!
						What does that really mean?
						The UGLY side of event planning is when you find out that the caterer/venue does NOT include china, flatware, glassware and adds a hefty charge to make all that happen. 
						To us, All inclusive means EVERYTHING is included in one price - NO PLUS PLUS.
						You won't have to worry about corkage fees, cake cutting fees, longer event time fees, early vendor fees, or gratuity.

					<h1> MENU </h1>
					<p> 
						We design each and every menu with thought.  We keep in mind the time of day, weather and regional and ethnic flare.
						We are not bound by any genre of food. The style can be what you wish. We are constantly creating exciting new items in our lab that you can enjoy in the future. 
						So have some flexibility when choosing a menu. You’ll be glad you did.

					<h1> FIXED COSTS </h1>
					<p> 
						Fixed costs will include, but are not limited to: types of China, flatware, glassware, tents, tables, chairs and even room fees. Your options and sources are endless. 
						It is our job to recommend which items fit best in your style and budget.
						The costs on the items in this category are fixed because we do not place any additional charges on them. 
						We will be able to coordinate the rental of these items through our preferred vendor network after discussing what type of experience you’d like your guests to have.

					<h1> SERVICE </h1>
					<p> 
						We will coordinate all of the staff needed to make your event run smoothly. 
						We provide whatever it takes to help you enjoy your event. 
						The number of staff needed will be determined based on the number of guests and what style of event you choose.
						At Schaal’s Catering & Events, we do not charge you corkage fees, cake cutting fees nor gratuity! We believe in a fair price for a fair product. 
						It’s kind of like having 18% more budget to spend on your guests.
